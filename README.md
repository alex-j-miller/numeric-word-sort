# Numeric Word Sort

This project is a full-stack web application that converts a list of numbers into their English word equivalents. Users can input numbers via a modern React frontend, which validates the input and displays the results in a user-friendly way. The backend, built with Node.js and Express, provides an API endpoint for converting numbers to words and includes robust validation and automated tests.
